#textReminder

---
A few months ago, I was prescribed a medication that I needed to take five times a day. Knowing I would struggle to remember, I combined several tutorials to create a program that texts me at the required times to remind me to take my medication. This project is ongoing, and I will continue to update it to include any useful features I discover. 

This program can be useful for anyone trying to send timed texts messages for any reasons, you can send to any phone number and send any message.
